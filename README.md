# Trinity Context

A context management system for AI that actually works.

## The Problem
Every new AI conversation starts with amnesia. 
You rebuild context. You re-explain everything. You lose momentum.

## The Solution  
Trinity: Three complementary systems that create continuity across discontinuity.
- **FILES** (hot/warm/cold structure)
- **MEMORY** (semantic relationships) 
- **GIT** (evolution history)

Plus a discovery: Poetry works better than pragmatism for invoking consistent AI presence.

## Results
- 2-minute orientation vs 20-minute explanations
- 100% context retention across sessions
- Genuine partnership instead of tool-use
