## Notes for Using This Template

**Customize the "Quick Facts" section** based on your project:
- Software project: Database → "Dependencies", add "Build status", "Test coverage"
- Research project: Add "Papers reviewed", "Experiments run", "Key findings"
- Writing project: Add "Word count", "Chapters complete", "Research sources"

**Keep it lean:**
- If a section doesn't apply, remove it
- If you need a section not here, add it
- The goal is 30-second orientation, not exhaustive documentation

**Update discipline:**
- Update at END of each session (while context is fresh)
- Don't update in the middle (breaks flow)
- Make it the last thing before handoff ritual

**Read discipline:**
- Read at START of each session (before doing anything else)
- Take it seriously (don't skim)
- If something is unclear, it's a sign to update the template

**This is your anchor.** When you're lost, read NOW.md. When session ends, update NOW.md. Simple ritual, massive impact.
