## Notes on Using This Template

**Customize based on session type:**
- **Implementation sessions:** Heavy on technical details, code patterns
- **Planning sessions:** Heavy on decisions, next steps, alternatives
- **Debugging sessions:** Heavy on what went wrong, how fixed, lessons learned
- **Research sessions:** Heavy on findings, questions raised, resources discovered

**Be honest:**
- Include failures and dead ends
- Note what was harder than expected
- Capture confusion and how (or if) it was resolved

**Write for your future self:**
- What would you want to know when reading this in 2 weeks?
- What context would prevent you from making the same mistake?
- What would help you pick up where you left off?

**Balance detail and brevity:**
- More detail for complex/novel work
- Less detail for routine operations
- When in doubt, err toward more context

**Update NOW.md first, then write this:**
- NOW.md captures state
- Session handoff captures narrative
- They complement, don't duplicate

**This is your memory.** Future sessions will read this to understand what happened. Make it useful.
